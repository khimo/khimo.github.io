# Nuki 

## Connecting
To connect to the Nuki bridge, simply set the IP of the Nuki bridge, the bridge LED will start blinking and the bridge button must be pressed within 30 seconds.
**The HTTP API must be activated in the *Nuki Bridge* menu to be able to connect to the bridge**


## Adding resources
Adding a resource can be done by introducing the resource's Nuki Id as address or, **preferably** by pressing the *Import resources* button and then *Load
resources from connected system*. If the resource is not discovered, check in the Nuki web interface if it's online.

## Supported resources
Currently only Nuki SmartLocks are supported, it is possible to lock (STATE = 0) and unlock (STATE = 1) as well set different lock action. Also it can check the battery, door and connection states.

## Lock in BeoLiving APP
Locks aren't visible in the app, to use it there are two options:
- Create Macros for locking and unlocking and make them visible in the scene view.
- Better way:
	1. Add a *Virtual resource* of type *Virtual button with LED*, then in the *Interface* tab, check the option *Confirm* of the virtual button (to avoid accidental pressing of the button).
	2. Create a macro that will, after pressing the virtual button, lock or unlock the lock (depending on previous state) and turn ON or OFF the LED (LED will be OFF if locked, ON if unlocked). 
	This macro should include 2 events: one with the Virtual Button as a resource and "PRESS" as the event, and the other with your Nuki Smart Lock as a resource and "STATE_UPDATE" as the event (with nothing checked). 
	
Below is a sample macro code that should be included as the command after pressing *Convert to code* in the Macros view. Remember to change the names of the Area, Zone, Smartlock and the Virtual Button, otherwise it won't work. 
For more tips and information about the BLI's lua macros, see [here](../../bli-guides/manuals/howto-lua-macros).

	function(event, engine)
	  your_area = "YOUR_AREA"
	  your_zone = "YOUR_ZONE"
	  your_virtual_button_name = "YOUR VIRTUAL BUTTON NAME"
	  your_nuki_smartlock_name = "YOUR SMARTLOCK NAME"
	  
	  nuki_smartlock_address = your_area.."/"..your_zone.."/GPIO/"..your_nuki_smartlock_name
	  virtual_button_address = your_area.."/"..your_zone.."/BUTTON/"..your_virtual_button_name
	  
	  local lock = engine.query(nuki_smartlock_address)
	  local state = lock[1].get_number("STATE")
	  

	  if (event.name() == your_nuki_smartlock_name) then
	    engine.fire(virtual_button_address.."/_SET STATE?STATE="..tostring(state))
	  else if (event.name() == your_virtual_button_name) then
	    if state == 1 then
	      engine.fire(nuki_smartlock_address.."/SET?VALUE=false")
	    else
	      engine.fire(nuki_smartlock_address.."/SET?VALUE=true")
	    end
	  end
	end
