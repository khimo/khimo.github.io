# Atlona OmniStream

Integration with the Atlona OmniStream devices

# Comunication with the System

Comunication with the Atlona OmniStream devices is made through two websockets for device, one for polling information and setting configuration parameters, and the other
for notifications of changes. For that purpouse the same user and password is needed on all the devices, and setted on the corresponding channel parameters of the driver.

**WARNING:** Have special care on the network setup, so the multicast streaming traffic of atlona is away from the B&O products network. Otherwise you may found connection
problems.

# Available Resources

The available resources are the following:

 - **Decoder** (MATRIX) - Any decoder and its desired output

 - **Encoder** (_ENCODER) - Any encoder

# Resource Address

Each device is represented as a resource, the decoders follows the standard Matrix Resource definition and the encoders a non standard _Encoder Resource 
definition that improves the meaning of the decoder as a matrix resource. The address for the encoder is the IP. For the decoder, it's the IP followed by ":HDMI OUTPUT" (eg: 192.168.42.200:1). If only one output is available the number should be 1.

The devices should use a FIXED IP or has an IP reserved in the DHCP server. 

# Resource Discovery

Discovery is not available on this system.

# Resource Events

There is no events for this resources

# Captured Events

As there is no events, you can't capture any

# Resource Commands

- Encoder command:
  - This resource doesn't have commands, its purpose is to query the streams to be set on a decoder

- Decoder commands:
  - **TURN_ON** - it enables the stream that is configures
  - **STANDBY** - it dissables the stream that is configures
  - **SELECT_INPUT** - given the ip of an encoder and its corresponding session, it sets the audio and video stream on the decoder to the adresses of that session 

The command "SELECT_INPUT" changes the multicast address and port of the inputs being used, this means that only one set of inputs (video and audio) is used for each HDMI output. 
When having more than one output, each used output should be already configured with different inputs.

# Resource States
  
- Encoder state:
  - **_ONLINE** - tells if the bli was abled to conect to the websockets of the device

- Decoder states:
  - **ONLINE** - tells if the bli was abled to conect to the websockets of the device
  - **INPUT** - the ip address of an encoder and the corresponding session from the stream that comes

# Sources

Sources should be edited to match user requirements in the *Interfaces tab*. The controller will get all the available sources from the defined encoders resources.

# Troubleshooting

- Make sure the setup is already working without the BLI, in other words, check that you are able to stream a source from one screen to another (if no source is available you can try with the video generator). 
  Some things to check are:
    - Matching multicast addresses, ports
    - HDCP version
    - Correct framerate, resolution
- If the BLI isn't able to connect to the devices, it may be because the network where the BLI is connected can't access the network where the Atlona devices are connected, check if you can access them by IP in a web browser to see if this is the case. 
- An error message that reads "Unable to open ethX:XXXX" may mean that the port trying to be accessed is already being used by another Atlona input. 
  When changing from one session to another, the BLI changes the multicast address and port of one input, no other input shuould have the ports used by the different sessions,
  either the port in the desired session or the port in the input should be changed.
