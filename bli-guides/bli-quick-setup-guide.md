_BeoLiving Intelligence_ is a Plug & Play home automation controller. The next steps show how to quickly set up your _BeoLiving Intelligence_.

## Setting up the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ {#setup}

> By default, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ comes configured in DHCP mode. This means it gets its IP address from the router it is connected to. To 
configure a static IP address, please refer to [BeoLiving Intelligence Advanced User Guide](bli_advanced_user_guide/).

**Follow the next steps to set up your BeoLiving Intelligence(BLI):**
 
1. **Connect BLI** 
    - Connect your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ to your LAN through its RJ45 ethernet port.
1. **Turn on BLI**
    - Power your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ using the AC power supply or by using PoE (Power over Ethernet) and wait until the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is in normal operation mode (the User LED goes solid green).
1. **Install the App**
    - Go to the store in your smart device, download and install the _BeoLiving App_.
1. **Open BeoLiving App**
    - When your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is ready a pop-up will appear. If you own more than one, you can identify them 
by the serial number located at the back side of each.
    - Once in the pop-up window press "_Request access_" and follow the instructions provided.
    - Your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ should appear on the _BeoLiving App_ main screen, ready to be used.

## Adding Bang & Olufsen products {#add-products}

1. **Go to App and press "Add products"**
    - In the main screen of the _BeoLiving App_, select your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ and click on "Add products". A list of the supported products that are on the same network will appear.
1. **Create zone**
    - Before adding a product, at least one zone (the room where the product resides) must be created. Click on "Create zone" and create one.
1. **Assign product to zone**
    - Select the product you want to add from the list and click on "Assign to zone". Assign the product to the zone you just created.
    - Return to the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ main screen and you should see the zone with the icon of the product added.

You can **add more products to that zone, edit products name, change products from zone and create more zones** by pressing **"Edit products"**. 
Note that only one icon per type of product will appear in the zone.

## Controlling Bang & Olufsen products {#control-products}

1. **Select zone**
    - Select the zone that the product you want to control is in.
1. **Select source**
    - In the bottom left corner press the "Source" button. A list of all the products in the zone will appear, including the available sources.
    - Select a source for the product you want to use, e.g.: "Deezer" in an M5 speaker.
    - Once a source is selected, **controls will be shown on the main screen**. What you control depends on the device and the source you have selected. You can control volume, select content, play, pause, etc.

## Creating Scenes {#create-scenes}

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ Scenes are the way you can control several products at the same time. 
> For example, you can create a Scene that sets the source of a speaker on _Deezer_, while at the same time setting _YouTube_ on a TV.

Each time you execute the Scene those commands will be executed on your _BeoLiving Intelligence_, and what's more, you can schedule the Scene to execute at a given time or periodically.
> E.g.: turn on the lights and close the shades each Tuesday at 10 o'clock. To configure a Scene, follow the next steps:

1. **Select a zone**
    - Select the zone where the Scene will reside.
1. **Create the scene**
    - In the top left corner press the "Scenes" button, and then press the "+" to create a Scene.
    - Give the newly created Scene a meaningful name.
1. **Add products**
    - In the list of available products, press "+" to add one to the Scene, and press on its name to configure the action that the product will do when the Scene is executed.
    - The configuration of an action is done through a screen that depends on the device selected. 
       + For instance, if it's a _Bang & Olufsen_ product it will be similar to a remote control, if it's a light it will be similar to a switch.
    - After selecting all the products you want to control and configuring their actions press "Done".
1. **Try it out!**
    - To fire a scene just press the name of it, or you can click on the clock icon to schedule it for certain time or day.

</div>

## Creating Product Groups {#products-groups}

Creating a group of Bang & Olufsen products lets you control all of them as if they were one. The content that the _master_ product reproduces is reproduced as well in the rest of the products in the group. **To create a group follow these steps**:

1. Go to the _Settings_ menu and select your _BeoLiving Intelligence_.
1. Go to _Device Settings_ and press _Group products_.
1. Press _Create group_ and select the _master_ product from the list.
1. Press the "+" button on each product you want to add to the group.
> Once the group is created, whenever content is reproduced in the _master_, it will be reproduced automatically in the rest of the products of the group. The same goes for volume control on the _master_.

	</div>
  </div>
</div>

## Setting content provider credentials {#set-credentials}

A new feature that comes with _BeoLiving Intelligence_ included in both of its modes, is the ability to set your user credentials for certain content providers(
_TuneIn_ and _Deezer_) to all _Bang & Olufsen_ devices. _BeoLiving Intelligence_ will set user credentials to every discovered device that has not been
set previously (this mean that _BeoLiving Intelligence_ does not override existing credentials). **To set content provider credentials follow the
 next steps**:

1. Go to the _Settings_ menu and select your _BeoLiving Intelligence_.
1. Go to _Device Settings_ and choose the content provider in _Accounts_.
1. Insert credentials and press _Login_.
> _STATUS_ will display credentials state. _BeoLiving Intelligence_ will verify if inserted credentials are valid or not after send them to a 
detected device without credentials.

## Controlling products with your voice

Most of the functionalities you can control with the _BeoLiving App_ can also be voice-controlled if you have an Amazon Alexa (or if you have it in your phone). 
> For instance, you could ask Alexa to "Turn on Deezer on the M5".

To be able to do so, a linking process must be done first: please refer to [BeoLiving Intelligence Link to Third Party Cloud Service Guide](bli-link-third-party-service.md). 

A complete list of the available commands can be found in [Alexa usage guide](bli-alexa.md) or at the Alexa skill 
description for the _BeoLiving Intelligence_.

<!--
## Integrating the BeoLiving Intelligence with other services

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ supports IFTTT, enabling integration with different services.
> For example, you could configure it to change the
 source of a TV by sending an email. 
 
 A linking process very similar to the one for Alexa has to be made first, please
 refer to [BeoLiving Intelligence Link to Third Party Cloud Service Guide](bli-link-third-party-service.md). A complete list of the available 
combinations can be found in the IFTTT page.
