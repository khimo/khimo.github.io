**This is the user setup menu**, their rights and interfaces are generated by _BLI PRO_. 

It's possible to configure the following features:
 
+ Users that can access the system and access restrictions.
+ Sources and features of A/V products.
+ Access to IP cameras in the house.
+ Resources and macros that appear in a zone.
+ Virtual resources that provide a friendly way of interacting with some systems.
+ Lists with favourite TV channels and radio stations.

The resources to be accessed via the user interfaces are configured in this page. The user interfaces are:

+ _BLApp_: _BLI_ specific user control application that could be installed on any _iOS_ based device.
+ _Webpanel_: User control interface accessible through _BLI_ web interface.
+ _TV overlay_: User control interface application accessible through any _Bang & Olufsen_ NetworkLink TV as _Home Control_. Same layout as 
_Webpanel_.

Configurations are synchronized in real time towards the _Webpanel_ and the _TV overlay_. Synchronization with the _BLApp_ is done 
periodically and could be forced by activating **Configuration > Quick save revision**.

#### Users - admin

The user named _admin_ is a user that exists per default and is meant for the technician/installer. It has access to set up the _BLI PRO_
and is allowed to access all zones via browser or _BLApp_.

##### Change password for admin user

Per default, _admin_ password is unknown but it can be set to "_admin_" by activating the Setup button function No.2 ([See button functions](https://khimo.github.io/bli-guides/bli_advanced_user_guide/05-user_button)). This 
password will last 5 minutes (for security purposes) during which a new one must be set. Press the _admin_ entry in the left column to change password (see figure above).

#### Users - new user

To add a new user press "**+**" sign in the **Users** header (left column).

##### User properties

Configure User properties by entering a name under the _Name_ field and password in the _Password_ field. 
Then select options according to the following:

+ **User management access**: when selected, the user is allowed to administer users and user-rights. This option should be set for the owner of 
the installation or a ‘superuser’ who is responsible for managing user access.
+ **Can edit config from the application**: when selected, the user is allowed to create scenes and edit device settings or zones from the _BLApp_.  

##### Select zone access for user

Finally, choices should be made in _Select zone access for user_. _All zone access_ may be selected or a selection of individual zones from the list presented.

#### B&O products

For B&O products there are some basic options and a source list that can be presented to the user.

When selecting any product, the next sections are displayed.

##### NetworkLink product: area/zone/product

</div>
<br>

- **Name**: Possibilty to rename the product.
- **Address**: The product's serial number.
- **Force IP address**: Define a fixed IP address to connect to the product. This is not recommended and should only be used as a workaround in 
situations where product discovery has shown not to be reliable. 
>> It may also be used to access equipment installed on another (reachable) network.
- **Beo4 navigation**: Whether the product is set up for the old Beo4 navigation or the new navigation with cursor keys and SELECT.
- **Show product sources on their zone**: Hides product sources in its zone if not selected.

<br>

This is synchronized automatically from the product configuration (if the product is online). In case of any problem with automatic source synchronization, 
_Force synchronization with product_ button will get the current sources of the product. 

The information provided in the _Sources in product_  section for each source is the following:

- **Source**: Type of source. 
- **Name**: Source label in all user interfaces.

  - **Confirm**: If this option is enabled, after a button press or after a macro is triggered the action will need confirmation on a hand held device.
>>> E.g. pressing a Yes button to avoid unintended activation before the desired function is executed. This could be when an
  action should not take place unintended, e.g. activating ‘Vacation mode’.
  - **Compact**: When enabled the button in the user interface will be shown in a half-width button. 
>> E.g. there is room for two buttons per line.
  - **On camera view**: With ‘On camera’ enabled, when using _WebPanel_ the half-width button will be shown next to the IP camera images in that zone. When _BLApp_ is used, the button will be shown in the _Cameras_ section of _BLApp_.

#### Favourites Lists {#fav-list}

favourite channels/stations are listed by name and logo if such is selected.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://khimo.github.io/bli-guides/pictures/bli-pro-user-guide/interfaces-fav-lists.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Interfaces Favourite lists"/>
</div>
<br>

To add a new favourites list, press the "**+**" sign in the _Favourites Lists_ column entry. In the top left field of the display, enter the source provider's name. The **Clone** button (top right) is used to clone an existing source provider of favourites. The new one will show in 
the left column list, adding ‘Clone of’ to the name. The **Remove** button is used to remove a source provider of favourites chosen in the left 
column.

##### Commands global options

For each favourite list a global _End command_, a global _Delay_ and a global _Delay on source selection_ that will affect each favourite command 
can be set.

+ **End command**: The end command is added at the end of each favourite command sequence and can be either _NONE_, _PLAY_ or _SELECT_.
+ **Delay**: The global delay is a delay value added between all digits and between digits and the end command for each favourite command.
+ **Delay on source selection**: Delay that will be added previous to the first digit for each favourite command sequence, if source was 
effectively selected (i.e.: if the source was already selected, this delay will not be set).

##### List of favourites

For each listed TV channel/radio station the following information should be provided:

+ **Caption**: A short description for the favourite. The caption will be filled in automatically when the logo picker is used. If edited it will 
remain unmodified. The caption will appear in the user interface.
+ **Command**: The command that is executed when a logo is selected in the _BLApp_. See in Help for full explanation of combining elements in
the command string. The command must be filled in manually.
+ **Logo**: A logo can be fetched using the logopicker, see below, or by entering sufficient information in the URL field for the favourite. The 
logo will be shown in the user interfaces.
+ **URL**: The full URL of the logo image to show. The URL must point out the valid image as it will be used periodically by _BLApp_ to retrieve 
the logo. The URL will be filled in automatically when the logo picker is used. The URL can be entered manually.

##### Logo picker

The logo picker shows a pop-up window for selecting logos from the B&O repository and shows up by clicking the logo. Available logos are
shown in groups of 50. It is possible to search for a channel using the filter. A search string will immediately restrict the channels displayed 
to only the matching entries. When a logo has been chosen the picker window will close and complete the URL path and command fields, and show the 
selected logo. The caption will also be updated, but not if it has been edited explicitly.

> _Note_: The logo picker only works when an Internet connection is available.
