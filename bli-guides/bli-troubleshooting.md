## Introduction

The scope of this guide is a troubleshooting guide for installers in case of inappropriate behavior or a malfunction of the
_BeoLiving Intelligence_.

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ has three complementary methods in case of malfunctions of your equipment:

+ [Service report](#service-report)
+ [System button reset](#system-reset)
+ [Erase all configuration and settings](#erase-configuration)

## Service Report {#service-report}

_Service report_ is a useful tool for debugging purposes. It creates a _.tar.gz_ file that contains important information that could be helpful 
to reproduce any issue or malfunction and to understand the setup of the installation. 

This information roughly contains:

+ _BeoLiving Intelligence_ logs of the last days of operation.
+ All _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration files of the _Revision history_, including active configuration.

The _Service report_ section can be found in _BeoLiving Intelligence_'s web interface at the _Top bar_ and in _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_ at **Tools > Service reports**. 

In this section, a form (to be completed) and the _Download_ button are found.   

Steps to follow are:

1. Copy/Paste the form into an email addressed to _**support@khimo.com**_. 
1. Complete the form in the most detailed way in order to help us to resolve the issue quickly and effectively.
1. Attach the _Service report_ and send.

Our team will study your case and will reach you as soon as possible with instructions.

## System reset button {#system-reset}

On the back side of the _BeoLiving Intelligence_, next to the _User button_, the system reset button is found. Press for 8 seconds to *reboot* the _BeoLiving Intelligence_. This method must be used if the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is not able to restore its proper operation. After normal operation is restored, a [Service report](#service-report) must be generated to let us check what issue 
occurred in your controller.

## Erase all configuration and settings {#erase-configuration}

An alternative, having backed up your current _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration, is to erase all the configurations and settings of your 
controller. This could solve conflicts immediately between your current configuration and firmware, but has the risk of losing previous 
configurations if not done carefully. Use the [setup button function 5](bli_advanced_user_guide/05-user_button)  to erase all the configurations and set the unit to the factory defaults.
