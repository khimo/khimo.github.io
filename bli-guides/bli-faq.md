#### Q: How do I upgrade the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ to PRO mode?

While logged in as "_admin_" user ([How do I access the setup interface as admin?](#admin-password)), at the top menu bar the **ESSENTIAL** access page contains information regarding your _BLI_ and _Licensing information_.
In _Product information_, the _License type_ shows the current license of your _BLI_, with a link for upgrading to _BLI PRO_. This link will redirect you to *Khimo.com*, where you can start the upgrade process via _PayPal_.

Once the payment process finishes, your _BLI_ will be automatically upgraded to _PRO_ mode within a minute approximately.

## Setup
#### Q: How do I get my _BeoLiving Intelligence_ IP address?

You can find out the IP address of your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ in several ways, some suggestions:

- Use a network scanner/IP-scanner (e.g. the free-ware Fing). The best result is obtained using a hand held device; remember to access the Wi-Fi 
network used by the _BeoLiving Intelligence_.
- Using a computer on the same network as the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ and an application that supports Bonjour discovery (e.g. the Safari browser
, avahi-browse), lookout for "\_hipservices.\_tcp." service.
- Access to your _LAN_ router and search for the assigned IP to _BeoLiving Intelligence_. 

#### Q: How do I access the setup interface as admin? {#admin-password}

An installer can gain access to _BeoLiving Intelligence's_ setup interface with the _admin_ user. This user has a first-time access procedure, the installer may use the Setup function 2 to set the _admin_ password to _"admin"_ for 5 minutes, the _BLI_ will then request a new password as soon as the web interface is accessed.

## BLI Operation

#### Q: I can't connect my _BeoLiving Intelligence_ to a certain HA system, what should I do? 

- Check that both _BeoLiving Intelligence_ and the HA system are connected to the same _LAN_ network.
- Check the connectivity of each system (e.g.: ping _BeoLiving Intelligence_ and HA system).
- In the _Systems_ section of the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ web interface, check that the _Connection settings_ of the HA system are correctly configured.
- Try to provoke a system reset of the HA system and check if the connection can be established.

If the connection can't be restored, follow the instructions in [BeoLiving Intelligence Troubleshooting Guide](bli-troubleshooting.md) for creating a _Service report_ of your _BeoLiving Intelligence_.

#### Q: How can I find the specific source of an A/V device in _BLApp_?

Sources shown in the _BLApp_ are managed in the _Interfaces_ section of the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ web interface. Select the device that contains the source, and check that the source's "_Hidden_" check box isn't selected.
For more information regarding configuration of user interfaces check _Interfaces_ section of [BeoLiving Intelligence PRO User Guide](bli-pro-user-guide/#interfaces). 

#### Q: What does the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ LED state mean?

The LED on the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ displays it's current state, as shown in the following table:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" style="color: #eb5946">Activity</th>

  </tbody>
</table>

#### Q: How can I control my _BeoLiving Intelligence_?

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ has multiple ways of controlling your house. From factory, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ can be controlled using the _BeoLiving App_, or using your _Voice_ (by linking your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ with _Alexa_, for example).
After upgrading your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ mode to _PRO_, you will also be able to control your house through the web interface and the _Home Control_ native application on Bang & Olufsen TVs.

#### Q: Can I control the BLI with my voice?
Yes, using Alexa, Google Assistant or other 3rd party services through IFTTT. See [BeoLiving Intelligence link to 3rd party Cloud Service guide](bli-link-third-party-service.md) for more information.

#### Q: Can I control my devices from outside my house?

Once your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is on _PRO_ mode, you will be able to control your house from anywhere. You can enable remote access by going to your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ settings on the _BLApp_.

#### Q: How can I find what _FUNCTION_ number corresponds to the LIGHT list controls on my BeoRemote?

The LIGHT and CONTROL lists on your BeoRemote (i.e.: GOODBYE, MORNING, etc.) correspond to different function numbers (i.e.: LIGHT FUNCTION 17, LIGHT FUNCTION 1, etc) that can be used as _Events_ to trigger _BLI Macros_.

To find out what function number corresponds to each name, you may go to the Monitor tool and see what Event comes in when you press each button. Or directly on the Macro creation page, under Events, press Capture and the Events you press will now appear to add directly to your Macro.  

#### Q: How can I access a media library stored in a BeoMaster 5, or similar NAS (Network-Attached Storage), connected via DLNA?

On the BeoLiving app, you can access these media libraries by selecting any music source on a product (E.g: Music, Deezer, TuneIn, etc.), and pressing the "Content" button that can be found to the center-right of the screen.

Take into account that once the Storage device is connected, it will take some time to retrieve all the information on to the BLI. In the case of a full BeoMaster, this can take up to hours.


## MasterLink products

#### Q: Does the BeoLiving Intelligence support Bang and Olufsen's MasterLink products?

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ does not support MasterLink products directly, however they can still be used with the BLI via a BeoLink Converter or using the _MasterLink Gateway Protocol_ driver that enables **control** of *MasterLink* products **through a *BeoLink* or *MasterLink Gateway***.

#### Q: What is the function of a BeoLink Converter NL/ML?

This device converts audio between the analogue world (Master Link) into a streaming signal (Network Link) and vice versa. It also handles sending control signals (Prev, Next, Play, Pause, etc.) between ML and NL products while they play BeoLink Multiroom.

#### Q: Can I start a source on a Master Link audio/video master to play on a Network Link product through BLI?

Yes you can, but you need the BeoLink Converter NL/ML and it has to be configured correctly. See the BeoLink Converter NL/ML - [Installation Guide](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/product-support/accessories/beolink-converter-nl-ml). It is **NOT** possible using the _MasterLink Gateway Protocol_ driver.

#### Q: Can I control Link rooms in my Master Link setup through BeoLiving Intelligence?
No. 

#### Q: Can I select borrowed sources from the BeoLink Converter NL/ML on Network Link products?
Yes, if the borrowed sources have been configured and are part of the source list inside the Network Link product, then they can be selected using the BLI.  

#### Q: What is the MasterLink Node (MLN) and how do I configure it?
The MLN is needed when configuring the MasterLink Converter or when adding MasterLink products to your BLI through the MLGW Protocol using a BLGW or MLGW. It is configured on the web _Setup_ page of the gateway under *Interfaces-->B&O Products* for each MasterLink product.

## Other issues
#### Q: If the power goes off, do I lose the _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration?

_BeoLiving Intelligence_'s configuration is persistent, so all configuration and programming will be safe if any power-off occurs.

#### Q: How do I know which _Home Automation_ systems can be integrated?

The list of _Home Automation_ systems that are supported out of the box can be found here: [System Drivers Guide](../help_drivers). However, new _Home Automation_ systems are added with each firmware update and on the online repos.


#### Q: Are the firmware updates necessary?

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ comes by default with automatic firmware updates enabled. You can choose to turn-off that option, and check for firmware 
updates manually.  Firmware updates are highly recommended in order to avoid malfunction or abnormal operation.

#### Q: How can I solve display errors on the _Home Control_ TV app?

Try to clear the data and cache of _HAWebPanel_ application. For TV's with Video Engine 3.0 (Android TV's), go to **Settings > Android Settings > Device - Apps > System apps - HAWebPanel**.
 
#### Q: How do I migrate from a BeoLink Gateway to a BeoLiving Intelligence?

The _BeoLink Gateway_ configuration is fully compatible with the _BeoLiving Intelligence_. Check our [detailed description](bli-for-blgw-installers.md#blgw-migration) for further information about the migration process.

#### Q: Where can I buy a BeoLiving Intelligence?

You can buy the BeoLiving Intelligence from any Bang & Olufsen dealer or by contacting us at info@khimo.com
