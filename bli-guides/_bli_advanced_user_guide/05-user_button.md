_BLI_ has a button on it's upper side which provides several functions during normal operation.

To execute a function, press and hold the setup button. This will cycle through all available functions as indicated by the LED blinking (it will blink once for function 1, after a while it will blink twice for function 2 and so on).

Release the button when you get to the desired function number, where the LED will start to blink waiting for a confirmation. Press the button again in order to confirm the function execution.

- **Function 1**: Reserved.
- **Function 2**: Set _admin_ username's password to _"admin"_ (valid for the following) 5 minutes. Check the [*Setup interface*](06-web_interface_usage#setup-interface) section for further information.
- **Function 3**: Set network settings to fixed IP (192.168.1.10).
- **Function 4**: Set network settings to use DHCP.
- **Function 5**: Erase all configuration and settings.

In addition to being used to confirm the input function, a single press during normal operation is used to fire System events (refer to [_BeoLiving Intelligence PRO User Guide_](/bli-guides/bli-pro-user-guide/)).

### Step by step example

1. With the BLI in normal operation (green light on), **PRESS & HOLD** the button

1. The BeoLiving Intelligence will now erase all configuration and settings, this may take up to a minute

A video example showing the use of Function 2 to set the BLI's password to "_admin_" is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxjk1Tv4PM4).
